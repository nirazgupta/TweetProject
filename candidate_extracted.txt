2016-02-03 14:22;realDonaldTrump;Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare - repeal and replace!
2016-02-03 13:25;realDonaldTrump;The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
2016-02-03 13:20;realDonaldTrump;This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud pic.twitter.com/tRM7KUCrSU
2016-02-03 08:28;realDonaldTrump;Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
2016-02-03 08:21;realDonaldTrump;And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice" - a total lie!"
2016-02-03 08:10;realDonaldTrump;The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
2016-02-03 08:07;realDonaldTrump;Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
2016-02-03 07:47;realDonaldTrump;Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

2016-02-09 15:32;SenSanders;Republicans should stop politicizing the right of women in this country to control their own bodies.
2016-02-09 10:43;SenSanders;Climate change is real and caused by human activity.Our job is to aggressively transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.
2016-02-08 19:37;SenSanders;We must learn from other nations who say to their young people: You want to go to college? You can go to college, regardless of your income.
2016-02-08 08:15;SenSanders;In the year 2016, a job must lift Americans out of poverty, not keep them in it. We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.
2016-02-07 18:27;SenSanders;Your ability to vote shouldn’t depend on whether you have a car or how much money you have. It’s your right, plain and simple.
2016-02-07 13:08;SenSanders;In the United States, CEOs make 300 times what their workers make. This is simply immoral and must be dealt with.
2016-02-07 08:07;SenSanders;There was once a time when the United States was No. 1 in infrastructure. Today we are No. 12. We need to invest in our infrastructure.
2016-02-06 18:07;SenSanders;Every year, the federal government makes billions of dollars in profits off of student loans. We must end this most revolting practice!
2016-02-06 13:19;SenSanders;America should be known as the country with the best educated population in the world, not the country with the most people in jail!

2016-02-06 08:14;SenSanders;Enough is enough! This great nation belongs to the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists.
2016-02-05 20:07;SenSanders;There is no reason why the United States is the only major country on Earth that does not have a family and medical leave policy.
2016-02-05 18:10;SenSanders;There is something profoundly wrong when one family in America, the Walton family of Walmart, owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent.
2016-02-05 08:09;SenSanders;There is no reason that American workers should be denied paid family leave, a benefit that workers in every advanced economy already enjoy.
2016-02-04 20:09;SenSanders;I believe it is time for the United States to join almost every other Western, industrialized country and say no to the death penalty.
2016-02-04 17:48;SenSanders;30% of every health care dollar spent in the United States goes to administrative costs, rather than to delivering care. We can do better.
2016-02-04 08:09;SenSanders;Let's face it: until we put patients over profits, our health care system will not work for ordinary Americans.
2016-02-03 19:39;SenSanders;In the United States of America, you should not be forced into bankruptcy because you are diagnosed with cancer.
2016-02-03 17:44;SenSanders;It's outrageous that in the industrialized world, the United States is No. 1 in billionaires and No. 1 in childhood poverty.
2016-02-03 15:09;SenSanders;When millions of working Americans are still living in poverty, it is absolutely imperative that we raise the minimum wage to a living wage.
2016-02-03 12:59;SenSanders;It's outrageous we still have 29 million people in this country who have zero health insurance. This has got to end!
2016-02-03 10:42;SenSanders;When the average Social Security benefit today is just $1,328 a month, it's time to extend and expand Social Security benefits not cut them!

2016-02-02 20:19;SenSanders;It's unacceptable that Republicans want to cut Social Security, despite the fact that some seniors are trying to survive on $13,000 a year.
2016-02-02 20:03;SenSanders;The bottom line is: do we cut social security benefits or do we ask the wealthiest corporations and Americans to pay their fair share?

2016-02-02 10:44;SenSanders;Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
2016-02-02 08:03;SenSanders;It is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor, to stand with working people and, when necessary, take on the powerful.
2016-02-01 18:03;SenSanders;We must move towards a democracy where one can run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and the powerful.
2016-02-01 15:37;SenSanders;Why is it that, despite huge advancements in technology and productivity, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages?
2016-02-01 13:03;SenSanders;The American people understand that our current economic system is rigged against them and designed to benefit the top 1%.
2016-02-01 10:38;SenSanders;It’s time to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.
2016-02-01 08:09;SenSanders;We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but few Americans know it because so much of the new income goes to those on top.
2016-01-31 20:07;SenSanders;It is unacceptable that Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
2016-01-31 18:22;SenSanders;It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose new fossil fuel pipelines.
2016-01-31 16:06;SenSanders;The United States must join the rest of the industrialized world and recognize that healthcare is a right of all, and not a privilege.
2016-01-31 13:26;SenSanders;Instead of sheltering profits in the Cayman Islands, the largest corporations in this country must pay their fair share of taxes!
2016-01-31 10:43;SenSanders;It is an outrage that the CEOs of large corporations are calling for tax breaks while the middle-class of this country is disappearing.
